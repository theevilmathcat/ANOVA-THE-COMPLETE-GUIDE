🔍 Introduction

ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method for comparing group means by analyzing variances. This guide explains:

    How ANOVA partitions total variability into between-group and within-group components

    The F-ratio calculation and interpretation

    Why we analyze variances to compare means

    Practical applications in weightlifting research

📊 Types of ANOVA

The guide organizes ANOVA into 7 classification systems:
1. By Number of Factors

    One-way, Two-way, Three-way, and higher-order ANOVAs

    Weightlifting examples: Training programs, gender effects, experience levels

2. By Design

    Between-subjects vs. Within-subjects (Repeated Measures)

    Mixed designs combining both approaches

3. By Factor Type

    Fixed factors vs. Random factors

    Mixed models with both fixed and random effects

4. By Cell Structure

    Balanced vs. Unbalanced designs

    Implications for analysis and interpretation

5. By Additional Design Types

    Randomized Block Designs (RBD)

    Nested/Hierarchical ANOVA

    Crossed factorial designs

6. Special Case - ANCOVA

    ANOVA with covariates

    Controlling for confounding variables like bodyweight

7. Variance/Assumption Corrections

    Welch's ANOVA for unequal variances

    Greenhouse-Geisser/Huynh-Feldt corrections for repeated measures

🖥️ Minitab Procedure

Complete step-by-step workflow:

    Fit the ANOVA Model - Using General Linear Model

    Check Normality - Anderson-Darling test on residuals

    Verify Homogeneity of Variances - Test for Equal Variances

    Diagnostic Plot Interpretation - The 4-in-1 residual plots

    Decision Rules - When to transform data or use non-parametric alternatives

📈 Graphical Interpretation

Detailed explanation of Minitab's diagnostic plots:

    Normal Probability Plot (QQ plot)

    Residuals vs. Fitted Values

    Histogram of Residuals

    Residuals vs. Observation Order

🔬 Further Tests

Post-ANOVA procedures:

    Pairwise comparisons (Tukey, Bonferroni, Scheffé, Fisher LSD)

    Interaction plots for factorial designs

    Main effects plots

    Multicollinearity assessment using VIF

📖 Terminology

Comprehensive glossary covering:

    ANOVA-specific terms (factors, levels, groups)

    Regression connections (ANOVA as a special case of regression)

    Statistical concepts (bias-variance tradeoff, multicollinearity)

    Portuguese-English translations of statistical terms

🎯 Target Audience

    Sports science researchers

    Exercise physiology students

    Strength and conditioning coaches

    Statistics students with interest in applied research

    Minitab users analyzing experimental data

📄 File Structure

The guide is organized as a single comprehensive Markdown document with:

    Clear section headers

    Code blocks for data examples

    Decision rules and interpretation guidelines

    Practical tips for real-world applications
